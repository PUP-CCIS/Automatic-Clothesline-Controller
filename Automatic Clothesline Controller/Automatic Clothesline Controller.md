# Automatic Clothesline Controller
## The concept of this project is a mobile controller that can manipulate the Automatic clothesline that we have created. the mobile application is connected through the use of internet network technology and the use of port forwarding to accept and perform the request from the controller. 
(we will not make use of API in this proposal)

### Statement of the Problem
here are the problems that the mobile application should solve.
	1. Conflict on the schedule A lot of people are going to work early but unfortunately late when arriving home that's why they don't have the time to air dry their laundry causing it to have an unpleasant smell.  
 
	2. Unpredictable weather Despite new technology, 100% accuracy in weather prediction is not possible. That's why when you leave your laundry outside while it's raining, it causes it to not smell good. 
 

### Proposed Solution
We've come up with the following solutions to the problems stated:

	1. we will create an app that can control the clothesline anywhere with the use of the internet or with the use of local network where the Automatic clothesline is connected.

	2. there is an option in the app where you can choose whether the mode is on Automatic or manual retrieval of clothes.


### Target Users
This is where you state the users of your app. You can enumerate them if you're targetting several groups, along with a description that corresponds to their usage of the solution.

	1. To the Senior citizens. It will be a great help for the old—yet young at heart—to make their work easier with a click of a button. They will never complain about their aching back again. Because the clothesline will automatically retrieve the clothes from outside as soon as it detects rain. 

	2. To the Students. It will be a great help for students who are busy with their projects to make their clothes line-dried. Because not only clothes will be fresh scented or sun kissed but also straighten and no need for ironing. 
 
	3. To the Reclusive people. It will be a great help as they save an amount of effort and time in retrieving their clothes. Specially those who are independently alone in their home. 
 
	4. To the Busy Professionals. This study will help Busy Professionals to maximize their time on work, without thinking about the hassle to monitor and control their hanged clothes outside; with a minimum amount of effort to retrieve them when the rain comes. 
 

### Benefits
here are the benefits of the application in terms of solving the problem:

	1. the app can save energy because the clothesline make use of the sun to try clothes rather than the dryer which can cost you a lot of energy consumption. you can assure that the clothes are dry even in a rainy season. 
	
	2. less effort on retrieving the clothes outside because it automatically go inside if its on automatic mode.
	
	3. you can do other things while not worrying about the hanged clothes outside.
